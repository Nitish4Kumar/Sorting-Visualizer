# Sorting-Visualizer

Developed an interactive Sorting Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features start and stop buttons, algorithm selection, and real-time visualization of sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. This tool aims to enhance the understanding of sorting techniques by providing a visual representation of the algorithm's process. It dynamically updates the display as the sorting progresses, making it easier to grasp the concepts and efficiency of different sorting methods.
